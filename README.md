# Smoke Alarm Using Sensor 🔥

A compact and cost-effective smoke detection system designed using Arduino and the MQ-2 gas sensor. This project aims to provide an early warning system for detecting smoke and harmful gases to prevent potential fire hazards in homes, industries, and public spaces.

## 🚀 Overview

This project involves building a smoke alarm system that uses the **MQ-2 gas sensor**, **NodeMCU ESP8266**, and **Arduino** components. It can differentiate between air quality states such as normal air, cooking smoke, and fire smoke, and triggers a buzzer alarm when a threshold is exceeded. The system is simple, low-cost, and scalable.

## 📦 Features

- 🔥 Detects smoke, LPG, alcohol, propane, methane, and other gases.
- 📡 Zigbee wireless transmission (or ESP8266 WiFi) for IoT integration.
- 🔊 Buzzer alert system for immediate notification.
- 🔧 Built using easily available components.
- 📈 Real-time sensor readings and thresholds via Serial Monitor.

## 🛠️ Components Used

- Arduino Uno
- NodeMCU ESP8266
- MQ-2 Gas Sensor
- Buzzer (Piezoelectric)
- Jumper Wires
- 9V Battery & Power Supply
- PCB Board

## 🔧 Circuit & Working

The MQ-2 sensor detects gas concentration changes and outputs a voltage. This voltage is read by the Arduino. When it exceeds a specified threshold (e.g., due to smoke), the buzzer is triggered.


## 🧪 Applications

- Domestic gas leakage detection
- Industrial gas monitoring
- Smart home automation
- Air quality monitoring systems
- Safety systems in public places (hospitals, malls, hotels)

## 📈 Results

- Increased smoke/gas concentration → higher output voltage.
- System reliably detects fire smoke and common combustible gases.
- Real-time alert through buzzer when threshold is exceeded.
